Hiragana
--------

See also the _keyboard_ section in the main [`README.md`](README.md).

On Mac, go to _Settings / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Input Source_ to see the current shortcut to switch between English and Japanese - the default is `ctrl-space`.

Usually, the IME can work out when you need a small (chiisai) kana, e.g. type "sho" to get しょ. But you can use "x" to force this, e.g. "xo" becomes ぉ.

Apple Support have a complete overview of all the keyboard shortcuts [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/japanese-input-method/keyboard-shortcuts-jpim10263/mac), e.g. `ctrl-:` ot `ctrl-;` for roman letters, `ctrl-k` for katakana and `ctrl-j` to get back to hiragana.

Unfortunately, the use of `esc` and lots of `ctrl` keys makes this near impossible to use with [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) if this happens to be your favorite editor.

TODO: hiragana long vowels.

When found at the end of the word, the [sokuon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon) acts like a glottal stop (which may indicate angry or surprised speech). For example: あっ！ (from [here](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/how-to-write-in-japanese-hiragana-and-katakana-4-the-hiragana-t-column?lp=160)).

### ん

ん usually sounds like an n but can sound like:

* m if it comes before a b or p sound, e.g. こんぶ, しんぶん or かんぱい.
* ng if it comes before a g sound, e.g. はんがく.

### は, へ, を and ん

ん changes sounds based on context, は, へ and を have even clearer alternate sounds:

* は is wa when used as the topic marking particle.
* へ is e when used as a preposition.
* を is only really used as a particle and pronounced as o.

Katakana
--------

After typing e.g. "su" press `ctrl-K` to switch it from hiragana to katakana.

* ヴ - vu e.g. voodoo  ヴードゥー (vu-du-)

### Digraphs

* イェ - ye

* ウィ - wi
* ウェ - we
* ウォ - wo

* ヴァ - va
* ヴィ - vi
* ヴェ - ve
* ヴォ - vo
* Where's vu? It's above - just ヴ on its own.

ウォ may seem odd as there is ヲ - this seems to sum up the web consensus:

> を/ヲ isn't really pronounced "wo" anymore, it's generally pronounced like お.
> The only real reason ヲ still exists is because its hiragana counterpart を
> is used as a grammatical particle. But since particles are usually written in
> hiragana, ヲ is mostly useless.
> 
> If you want to express the sound "wo", ウォ is your go-to notation.

* シェ - she (which in addition to plain シ and the normal digraphs シャ, シュ and ショ gives us the full set of sh* sounds).
* ジェ - je

* チェ - che (like シ, the completes the full set of ch* sounds). チェア - chair.

Normally, digraphs are constructed with the *i kana in a column.

As that kana is chi in the t column, so you only get the sounds チ (chi) and ジ (ji).

If you want the sounds ti and di for loan words, this is done instead with te:

* ティ for ti
* ディ for di

And just to be difficult, for the tu/du sound to is used:

* トゥ for tu
* ドゥ for du

You can get the full set of f* sounds with ファ, フィ, フ, フェ and フォ.
