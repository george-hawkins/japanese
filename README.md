Japanese

Notes on starting to learn Japanese

Current plan
------------

**1.** Learn hiragana and katakana using resources below.

Using the _JapanesePod101_ lesson series (see below) and the Hiragana and Katakana Pro apps for drilling. And the self-study workbook [Learning Japanese Hiragana and Katakana](https://www.amazon.com/dp/4805312270) and the [Genkouyoushi notebook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D4RPJBN) for writing practice.

**2.** Learn all kanji using RTK and Skritter (and possibly using WaniKani later to learn readings).

**3.** Complete Genki 1 using the self-study material from _ToKini Andy_, along with "1000 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N5" from Collectif (_ToKini Andy_ suggests more actively learning this vocabulary than the chapter-by-chapter vocabulary introduced by Genki) and possibly using the Bunpro grammar site.

Will set up Anki as described by _ToKini Andy_ and _Jouzu Juls_.

Yomichan
--------

Yomichan was the main browser extension for hovering over words on any webpage to see dictionary definitions.

**However**, the extension repo has been archived, the project sunsetted and the batton has been passed to Yomitan.

At this stage, I have quite a lot of Yomitan notes, so I've split them out into [`yomitan.md`](yomitan.md).

Anki
----

Trenton has a nice into to setting up Anki for Japanese where he doesn't go mad on add-ons. He covers vocab vs sentence decks (he's not particularly anti vocab cards).

He also recommends the [Kaishi 1.5K deck](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi) as a good bootstrapping deck - i.e. acquire enough basic vocab that you can actually make sentence cards where all but one of the words in the sentence is unknown to you.

iOS and Android dictionary
--------------------------

_Japanese_ used to be a very popular Japanese dictionary for both iOS and Android.

The site still exists [here](https://www.japaneseapp.com/) but it seems to be dead at this stage, its Android [Play page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.renzo.japanese&pli=1) shows it isn't available for any recent phones. And its iOS [App Store page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/japanese/id290664053) shows it hasn't got an update since 2019.

Netflix
-------

Subscribing to Netflix Japan seems to have become very difficult in recent years - they've really clamped down on VPNs. And it's unclear to me if one can subscribe without a Japanese credit card.

It's not obvious that one can get a Japanese credit card without a non-tourist residence visa and Japanese address. It _may_ be possible to get a prepaid virtual card, without such identity verification, from [WebMonkey](https://en.komoju.com/blog/payment-method/webmoney/) or possibly [Kyash](https://thebestjapan.com/kyash-an-easy-alternative-to-credit-cards/) (I don't know if they have a virtual card or just a physical one).

Both NordVPN and ExpressVPN make a big deal of being suitable for use with Netflix but users report being frequently blocked.

For a take on the best VPN services for 2024, see Wired's [best VPN story](https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/) and Wirecutter's [similar story](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-vpn-service/). Both recommend Mullvad for privacy, which for a Hacker News reader sounds convincing and makes the articles seem more credible that the usual reviews that seem more like shills for NordVPN and ExpressVPN (the two VPN providers that are clearly spending the most on advertising). Being good at privacy doesn't imply a focus on circumventing geo-blocking, which is what one is looking for to access Netflix Japan and other Japanese streaming services - for this the Wired article suggests Surfshark VPN.

Note: once you've signed up to Netflix in a particular location, it is possible to mark yourself on indefinite holiday in another location so, it may be possible to simply switch to your own location and stop using a VPN.

You can find whether Netflix in your region has much Japanese language content using [uNoGS](https://unogs.com/) (unofficial Netflix online Global Search).

Just click _Advanced Search_, then _Uncheck All_ countries and just check your country, then set _Audio_ to _Japanese [Original]_ (and maybe set _Order_ to _Rating_) and click _Search_.

If you're logged into the Netflix website you can also search like this <https://www.netflix.com/browse/audio/jp>

Note: even Netflix Japan has none of the anime listed in [Top 10 Anime for Learning Real Japanese (JLPT N5 N4 level)](https://youtu.be/lktcZc9dYSI) (see below for the anime covered in this video).

Crunchyroll
-----------

[Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) has lots of anime but oddly it doesn't have Japanese subtitles. There are many theories as to why, e.g. that it's content is specifically licensed for non-Japanese markets.

### Download subtitles (for Crunchyroll, Netflix and more)

But there are ways to get around this, e.g. using the Chrome extension [asbplayer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/asbplayer-language-learni/hkledmpjpaehamkiehglnbelcpdflcab) (it's open source and also available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer)).

Or using [substital](https://substital.com/) or [Jimaku Player](https://github.com/sheodox/jimaku-player/) (tho' development stopped 2 years ago).

[jimaku.cc](https://jimaku.cc/) seems to be the place to download subtitles.

Note: Jimaku Player isn't associated with jimaku.cc - it's just one of many tools for playing subtitles from jimaku.cc.

Beginner anime
--------------

Note: where a series is both an anime and a manga, I've linked to the Wikipedia anime episode guide rathe than the manga page.

_Mochi real Japanese_ (in this [video](https://youtu.be/lktcZc9dYSI)) recommends (all are for beginners but she includes a difficulty and speed rating, 1 being the easiest):

* [Chibi Maruko-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_Maruko-chan) (ちびまる子ちゃん, lit. "Little Maruko-chan") - level 1, speed 2.
* [Doraemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon_(2005_TV_series)) (ドラえもん) - level 2, speed 2 (note there's the original 1979 version and a 2005 remake).
* [Azumanga Daioh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azumanga_Daioh) (あずまんが大王) - level 2, speed 2.
* [Nichijou (aka My Ordinary Life)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nichijou_episodes) (日常) - level 3, speed 2.
* [My Neighbor Totoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro) (となりのトトロ) - level 2, speed 2.
* [Kemono Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemono_Friends) (ものフレンズ) - level 3, speed 1.
* [Hetalia: Axis Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hetalia:_Axis_Powers_episodes) (ヘタリア Axis Powers) - level 4, speed 3 (the whole idea sounds amazingly culturally insensitive).
* [Polar Bear Café (aka Shirokuma Cafe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Polar_Bear_Caf%C3%A9_episodes) (しろくまカフェ) - level 2, speed 2.
* [Maison Ikkoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Maison_Ikkoku_episodes) (めぞん一刻, lit. "Ikkoku House") - level 4, speed 3 (comes up in lots of other people's recommendations too).

_That Japanese Man Yuta_ in [How to Learn Japanese with Anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXmPavo_quc) (at 5m 50s) recommends [Teasing Master Takagi-san](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Teasing_Master_Takagi-san_episodes) (からかい上手の高木さん, lit. "Good at Teasing, Miss Takagi")

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbcceTdyoQs), he recommends:

* Teasing Master Takagi-san - as above - he calls it his "number one recommendation".
* [Spirited Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away) (千と千尋の神隠し, lit. 'Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away').
* [My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Teen_Romantic_Comedy_SNAFU_season_1) (やはり俺の青春ラブコメはまちがっている, lit. "My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, as I Expected") - he loves it but says it's more difficult and recommends it for more advanced learners.
* [Haikyu!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikyu!!_season_1) (ハイキュー!!, lit. "Volleyball!!").

_Weeb Jail_ has a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-p7W9Jfmyda7wNKKOpO06AB2HrblVW-o) on learning Japanese with anime and in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL3UL3CNmVc) recommends:

* [Space Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Space_Brothers_episodes) (宇宙兄弟) - he does say this is driven by his interest in space and technology (which means he understands the context).
* [Your Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name) (君の名は) - his favorite (that he's rewatched lots of time) - comes up again and again as a favorite of other people too.
* [Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(TV_series)) (ポケットモンスター) - I guess someone had to mention it but he then goes on to say that while it's easy most of it is Pokemon names and their attacks and suggest instead Doraemon or...
* [Crayon Shin-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayon_Shin-chan_episodes) (クレヨンしんちゃん).
* [Death Note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note_(2006_TV_series)) (デスノート).
* [Midnight Diner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Diner_(Japanese_TV_series)) (深夜食堂) - actually live action rather than anime.

_ToKini Andy_ doesn't seem to have any anime-recommendation videos but he does have some interesting takes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeqU_RqJjsM) on the often recommended manga _Yotsuba to!_ (よつばと) (he points out that some of the grammar is deliberately wrong) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nJVz5Bf9t0) on Dorohedoro (ドロヘドロ) (for N2 and N1 level learners only).

_Misa_ also doesn't have any anime-recommendation videos but she does have this [manga one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua5lkcDvl_o) (where she recommends _Yotsuba to!_, _Shirokuma Cafe_ and more).

Popular anime
-------------

There are no end of lists of most popular anime (e.g. this [one](https://movieweb.com/most-popular-anime-of-all-time/) from MovieWeb or this [one](https://www.cbr.com/best-anime-of-all-time/) from CBR - both sites were acquired by Valnet and have an identical visual look and an odd load-as-you-scroll scheme that means if you jump down to see their number one choice, you have to wait for the loading to catch up).

IMDB also let's you view all anime sorted by popularity [here](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?keywords=anime) (where popularity is determined by how many people have visited the IMDB page for the series).

Anime that I keep coming across include ones like Doraemon and Shirokuma Cafe (see above) and:

* Dandadan
* Chainsaw Man
* Sakamoto Days
* Frieren: Beyond Journey's End
* Mob Psycho 100
* One Piece
* Naruto

### Animelon

While I don't want to recommend piracy, a lot of the anime one finds mentioned on YouTube and elsewhere are almost impossible to acquire legally in much of the world.

[Animelon](https://animelon.com/) hosts a well curated and huge library of pirated anime. And it seems actively geared towards helping learners with play-along transcripts (with the choice of Japanese with kanji or just hiragana or romaji along with translations and tests and exercises).

See their [about page](https://animelon.com/about) for much more - e.g. how you can customize subtitles and click on them for more details. It looks like a super resource and it's a pity it's not really legal.

There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to download their content and page loading and playback often takes a long time. Hosting and delivering video content isn't cheap and they seem to be generally underfunded (they take donations) and relatively frequently seem to disappear altogether for shorter or longer periods.

Pitch accent
------------

Pitch accent seems to be a controversial thing - some people seem to think it's essential and others that you can completely ignore it. _Metatron_ has a nice discussion of the "controversy" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwEw2WACbfc). Both he and ToKini Andy basically seem to say, you should probably ignore it until you're past N5 stage as there are more important things to focus on initially but that if you don't want your Japanese to sound weird, it's something you'll have to address eventually.

See _Dogen_'s [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxMXdmBM9wPvsySiMoBzgh8d68xqKz1YP). It starts with lots of short videos and then ends with a 2h 30m lecture. His [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dogen) also has lots of pitch-accent, pronunciation and phonetics material.

See _Jouzu Juls_'s japanese pronunciation [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOxRYmWDaF4) that recommends _Dogen_'s video but adds really useful pointers, e.g.:

* Using [minimal pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_pair) - he recommends the paid [Migaku Pitch Trainer](https://pitch-demo.migaku.io/) (but also mentions a free alternative - see below, it's the one Trenton mentions too).
* And if the whole thing is a complete struggle, he recommends a similar minimal pairs site but for music that has a [pitch section](https://www.musicca.com/exercises/circle/12) and an [interval section](https://www.musicca.com/exercises/circle/18) to get your brain attuned to the whole idea.

Matt vs Japan has a video with the infamous Ken Cannon where they discuss pitch accent but importantly also have exercises (around the 6m 30s mark - but the bits before are also important, e.g. not confusing stress in English with pitch accent): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaNr2xa4n3Q>

The `README` for the deck they created is [here](matt-ken-pitch-accent-deck/README.md), for the actual deck itself you need to use the link in the description section of the YouTube video.

Trenton (in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvCb5_Nzq4)) suggests this [minimal pairs test](https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/minimalPairs) (which is an open source GitHub project).

Basically every major Japanese YouTuber has a pitch accent lesson (in some cases I've used a title taken from the content if the real title wasn't very clear):

* _That Japanese Man Yuta_ - [How To Learn Japanese Pitch Accent The Simple Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp22QXysMHg).
* _Jouzu Juls_ - [Learn pitch accent before speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOxRYmWDaF4) (already linked above).
* _Matt vs Japan_ - [How to hear pitch accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaNr2xa4n3Q) (and see joint video with Ken Cannon linked above).
* _Japanese Ammo with Misa_ - [Pitch Accent & Pronunciation playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5-Wp_4tLqYkSIsRtsPbLIa0HnHkNzQW).
* _Kaname Naito_ - [Japanese Pronunciation: Pitch Accent Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8E-cU19PMs) and the newer [Basics of Japanese Pitch Accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt04eg9T2sE)
* _Speak Japanese Naturally_ - [The Very Basics of Japanese Pitch Accent | 2 Rules and 4 Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9OArpr2A78) - short but with practical advise and some really clear rules.
* _Mochi real Japanese_ - [Japanese Pronuciation Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wCNoFa0jU) (only very briefly touches on pitch accent at the 12m 10s mark).
* _Trenton_ - see above.
* _Dogen_ - see above.
* _JapanesePod101_ - see below.

Japanese pronunciation
----------------------

TODO: See already links to pronunciation guides from Dogen, Mochi and others above.

_Campanas de Japanese_ has a nice pronunciation [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGos75KF4PaQWko1d_WJEVSmH71QFaTa8) and covers IPA, long vowels, sokuon, rhythm, pitch and more.

### Japanese R sound

Tofugu has a nice [short lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2wzUuGm7yw) to teach you what exactly to do to make this sound. I wish he'd included subtitles - it's hard sometimes to here if he's telling you to say da or la or asking you to start saying ra.

_Campanas de Japanese_ also goes over what's involved [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpRArmZxfFM) and points out that _ri_ is a bit different.

See also this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUF5rAsaCKI) from _UBC eNunciate!_ (the tongue positions get clearer as they move from weird images of tongues moving within real people's mouths to diagrams).

Actually, there are no end of these videos - YouTube will start suggesting more and more once you watch one or two - try them and see what makes sense.

### Long vowels

_JapanesePod101_ has a [pronunciation lesson series](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson-library/ultimate-japanese-pronunciation-guide) that covers [pitch accent](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/ultimate-japanese-pronunciation-guide-10-perfecting-pitch-accent-in-japanese?lp=171) and [long vowels](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/ultimate-japanese-pronunciation-guide-8-the-secret-to-mastering-the-japanese-long-vowel?lp=171).

_JapanesePod101_, a little confusingly, often offers similar content multiple times presented by different teachers (though they also provide over-arching _pathways_ where they curate their currently recommended sequences of lessons for particular goals).

So, they also offer:

* [Kantan Kana #8: Hiragana や, ゆ, よ and long vowels](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/video-s2-8-kantan-kana-8).
* [Why Does a U Extend an O?](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/absolute-beginner-questions-answered-by-hiroko-4-why-does-a-u-extend-an-o) (there doesn't seem to be a similar one for _i_ extending _e_).

For a non-video take on things, including the odd issue with え and お sounds, see Coto Academy's [Long Vowels and Double Consonants](https://cotoacademy.com/pronunciation-in-japan-long-vowels-and-double-consonants-in-japanese/).

For an example of how you can probably over-think all this, see e.g. this _JapanesePod101_ [forum discussion](https://www.japanesepod101.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3245).

_JapanesePod101_ also have a [hiragana worksheets series](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson-library/learn-hiragana-with-worksheets) that includes a simple PDF [worksheet for long vowels](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/pathway-lessons-57-hiragana-worksheet-long-vowels?lp=411) (with answer key)..

_Campanas de Japanese_ has a nice [long vowels video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MBcIAEmucY) that as well as covering the oddities of writing also covers the rhythm involved and is more helpful than most in how to listen out for these sounds.

Seth Clydesdale maintains a huge site [Genki Study Resources](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons-3rd/) that includes a short double-consonants/long-vowel [listening exercise](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons-3rd/lesson-1/literacy-wb-7/).

The MIT OpenCourseWare site makes their [hiragana resource](https://mitocw.ups.edu.ec/resources/res-21g-01-kana-spring-2010/hiragana/) available and there they have a handout and online exercises for double consonants and long vowels. Note: they use the less-common romanization system called [Nihon-shiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-shiki_romanization#Romanization_charts) rather than the more common [Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization#Romanization_charts).

Videos with text
----------------

I've noticed various people using a tool that allows them to watch anime etc. and see the Japanese text along with all kinds of highlighting and additions for learners (e.g. pitch accent indicators, furigana and the ability to lookup words and export to Anki - in fact the Anki integrations seems very sophisticated, it can keep track of words that you've already got covered in your Anki decks).

I haven't looked into whether everyone is using the same tool but _Jouzu Juls_'s recommends Migaku. However, there's a legacy and new version, see his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGV1GrZlTvg) covering why you _may_ want to use the legacy version (his main issue may be resolved by the time you read this).

I haven't found a definitive video for the extension but try these:

* _Livakivi_'s [The ULTIMATE Guide to SENTENCE MINING!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBcQJESGQvc).
* _Budget Livakivi_'s [How to Use And Set-Up Migaku For Sentence Mining (Japanese)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tKINZwRzVs).

Yes, both are from the same person but he maintains two channels.

Migaku
------

Works with:

* Netflix
* Disney+
* YouTube
* Rakuten Viki

Rakuten Viki looks interesting in that it seems to be truly global (i.e. content available everywhere). However, it has only two Japanese anime series and seems to be mainly romantic dramas.

YouTubers
---------

* [_Dogen_](https://www.youtube.com/@Dogen/videos) - _Dogen_ seems to be the king of japanese YouTubers but he mixes comedy (which may be a bit confusing/unhelpful for beginners) with serious content. Some of his content is only available to Patreons (see [here](https://www.patreon.com/dogen)).
* [_Jouzu Juls_](https://www.youtube.com/@JouzuJuls/videos) - he isn't in the top league as far as subscribers go but I really like a lot of his videos.
* [_Matt vs Japan_](https://www.youtube.com/@mattvsjapan/videos) - he's another japanese YouTube star but unfortunately he seems to have ruined his reputation through activities outside YouTube (basically don't buy anything that's pushed by Matt) and hasn't produced any new YouTube content since early 2022. This all seems very sad as he comes across as very personable and I enjoy his videos and his YouTube persona is hard to reconsile with his behavior elsewhere (which you can find covered in videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfuENBQdEYo), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAXEjGkICrs) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zChi-zofP18) - the last one from Metatron gives Matt the greatest benefit of the doubt - there are many more similar videos on YouTube).
* [_ToKini Andy_](https://www.youtube.com/@ToKiniAndy/videos) - he's another YouTube star in this space and he's the one who tries hardest to take a structured taught approach to his content, he has lots of [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@ToKiniAndy/playlists) that e.g. go through learning the kanji or working thru Genki where he really tries to teach the content he's presenting. My feeling he's more practical than many other YouTubers and just gets down to learning rather than talking about learning. He's also migrated all his Patreon content to a subscription based [site](https://www.tokiniandy.com/) (that I suspect is well worth it, from what I've seen from him, but I haven't tried it yet).
* [_Robin MacPherson_](https://www.youtube.com/@RobinMacPhersonFilms/videos) - Robin is the least Japanese specific of my picks here but I find his content engaging, e.g. [developing speaking skills alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxHKkfbcRKQ) and he does have some Japanese specific content, e.g. this [grammar reference playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuIhQdwUVqqpq-aOnrEUjEq2oidCXbp9J).

Added later:

* [_That Japanese Man Yuta_](https://www.youtube.com/@ThatJapaneseManYuta)
* [_Japanese Ammo with Misa_](https://www.youtube.com/@JapaneseAmmowithMisa/videos) - Misa shows a more academic understanding of what she's talking about than most YouTubers (pointing out terms like [_okurigana_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okurigana) which I like but her content is still very accessible, she just points out such terms but doesn't weigh her discussions down with this kind of language).
* [_Kaname Naito_](https://www.youtube.com/@kanamenaito/videos) - takes a more "teacher" like approach (but without yet having any lesson plan-like playlists) with e.g. good introductions to the [rhythm of Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/@kanamenaito/videos).
* [_Trenton_](https://www.youtube.com/@%E3%83%88%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3/videos) - he has some interesting takes on some things (but doesn't have many videos out at this stage).

Honorable mentions:

* [_Mochi real Japanese_](https://www.youtube.com/@mochirealjapanese3430/videos) - some of the content seems a little light weight but there's some good stuff in there.
* [_Weeb Jail_](https://www.youtube.com/@WeebJail/videos) - he's definitely the most [_otaku_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku) of the creators linked here and most of his content is actually just English language anime related stuff but he does have some interesting Japanese language stuff (which he might have more usefully separated out into a second channel rather than having it mixed in with a sea of other stuff).
* [_Game Gengo_](https://www.youtube.com/@GameGengo/videos) - I haven't really decided what I make of this but it's an interesting idea - teeaching Japanese through video game content, e.g. he has a full [Genki 1 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT12i1gB38HGAc-zjgFA4YcJA2Z3gVZTL) where he goes chapter by chapter through Genki book 1 and covers all its vocab and grammar using video game content.

Finally:

* [_Learn Japanese with JapanesePod101.com_](https://www.youtube.com/@JapanesePod101/videos) - there's tons of great free content from [JapanesePod101.com](https://www.japanesepod101.com/) but if you can afford it, I think it's better to get a premium subscription on their site and consume the content there - even though their video player isn't as good as YouTube's, the content is presented with a lot of extras (e.g. transcriptions, extra text-based content and exercises) and in a lesson-plan structure. And the YouTube videos are sometimes heavily edited down versions of those on their site (e.g. the ones on hiragana are missing the stroke-order sections and the example words using the just learnt kana).

Textbooks
---------

There are obviously no end of textbooks for Japanese. However, I wanted one that used kana and kanji from the start rather than romaji and the king in this area is [Genki](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/).

Note: while Genki uses kanji and kana, it still uses a lot of English, i.e. it doesn't try to teach Japanese through Japanese.

The publisher has a [self-study site](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en/student/) for the book. And _ToKini Andy_ has a full [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA_RcUI8km1NMhiEebcbqdlcHv_2ngbO2) going through each chapter of the book. He also has this _great_ [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S55aWpRaV44) on how to really self-study with Genki. I think his [site](https://www.tokiniandy.com/) (requires subscription) is probably the way to go.

A huge number of people have developed resources to go with Genki, e.g. Seth Clydesdale maintains a huge site [Genki Study Resources](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/genki-study-resources/lessons-3rd/) - it's name might imply that it's pointers to other resources but it's a coherent set of online exercises to work through as you progress thru the book.

Another YouTube playlist for Genki is this [one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLouxzmENUE6RU9KZH-oCAvzwEKR1r9YP1) from _ShiroNekoJapanese_ - I haven't had a chance to look at it but it's an impressive amount of content and is linked to by others.

And see this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnEKCkcXNkol_qrzZBJDpwb7VQaJPnXiQ).

And I'm not really sure what [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT12i1gB38HGAc-zjgFA4YcJA2Z3gVZTL) is but it looks interesting - it may even be completely unrelated!

TODO: see which playlists really have value.

A new contender in this space is [Tobira](https://tobiraweb.9640.jp/) - _ToKini Andy_ compares it to Genki in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p60pe02X2O0).

Kanji

_Matt vs Japan_ makes a very convincing case for [Remembering the Kanji 1](https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/remembering-the-kanji-1-a-complete-course-on-how-not-to-forget-the-meaning-and-writing-of-japanese-characters/) by James W. Heisig [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgRte6oSoF8) (though note that in video description section he says "I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THIS VIDEO NOW" but the unfortunate consensus is that this coincides with Matt's attempt to monetize things with his own content and the content of this 2018 video is more valuable than his later monetization efforts).

Anyway, Remembering the Kanji (often referred to on forums as just RTK) looks like a great start to me.

And an interesting app for training stroke order looks to be [Skritter](https://skritter.com/) - it's subscription based and relatively and I don't know how much if anything it really adds over e.g. Anki (while paid, I believe you can continue revising all content you've seen/learned already forvever even if you end your subscription).

An interesting aspect to Skritter is that they also have lots of content that's tied to other learning resources, e.g. you can practice the kanji in the order and way they're introduced in Genki.

They have a nice [blog post](https://blog.skritter.com/2021/05/the-ultimate-guide-to-japanese-stroke-order/) that provides a far more in-depth set of rules for stroke order than just the common simple top-to-bottom left-to-right rule.

See this [StackExchange question](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/q/204/66028) about the stroke order of 右 and 左 for an example of how things aren't so simple (the first two answers are the most valuable).

See reviews [here](https://ltl-school.com/skritter-review/), [here](https://www.joyokanjikai.com/learning-japanese/skritter-review/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pglt4az_N0) (the last is by _Robin MacPherson_ who's mentioned above).

### Misc

You can find beautiful stroke order diagrams on [KanjiVG](https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/viewer.html?kanji=%E5%8F%B3) and using the data they provide you can use the [`kanjivg2svg` tool](https://github.com/Kimtaro/kanjivg2svg) to generate the kind of stroke order diagrams seen on [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/). Or you can download the full set of converted diagrams [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/awr5vw/downloading_stroke_order_image/) (but see follow-ups covering issues and see if those issues have been addressed in the latest version of the file available on Google Drive).

Hirigana and katakana
---------------------

This seems to be a slam dunk, almost everyone seems to recommend these pages from Tofugu:

* [Hirigana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)
* [Katakana](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/)

There's almost an excess of content here, e.g. for hiragana there's:

* There's the main page (linked to above), with mnemonics and audio.
* A [one page chart](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2014-06-30-learn-hiragana/hiragana-chart-by-tofugu.jpg) of all basic, dakuten/han-dakuten and combination hiragana.
* A [one page chart](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2016-03-07-hiragana-mnemonics-chart/hiragana-mnemonic-chart-by-tofugu.jpg) of all the mnemonics.
* A [Google Docs worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1muxTHS0NqIzKPUStedahoTRbvQRlUlQi0J3XMPi-DJE/) to print out and practice.
* An [online quiz](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/) to practice.
* A massive [Learn Hiragana Book PDF](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana-book-pdf) that features much of the content of the main page plus stroke order and writing practice (something the main page doesn't address at all) plus reading practice. Unlike the main page it doesn't feature any audio.

Note: the one page charts are both in JPG format (I would have used PDF or PNG).

This can feel a bit overwhelming and may convince one that the task is much harder that it ultimately is. I'd suggest using the PDF book as splitting things into page size chunks makes things less dauting that one apparently never ending web page.

Tofugu has also done a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dUxOTCkXEryT497YDSZu7uSOw5ICBwN) (one for each row/column of the hiragana chart). However, he never went further than the N row, i.e. he only got 5 rows in and then abandoned the project.

### JapanesePod101

While everyone recommends Tofugu (and it is a super resource), I preferred the _JapanesePod101_ ["How to Write in Japanese: Hiragana and Katakana"](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson-library/how-to-write-in-japanese-hiragana-and-katakana) series of lessons (which, despite its title, starts with teaching you to read/recognise the kana before going into the writing).

The first lesson is free but you have to subscribe to _JapanesePod101_ for the rest. I'd highly recommend doing so.

An alternative to subscribing is to watch the video for the lessons combined into two one hour long videos:

* [Learn ALL Hiragana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p9Il_j0zjc)
* [Learn ALL Katakana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6DKRgtVLGA)

The videos are somewhat compressed forms of the ones available on the _JapanesePod101_ site (they cut down on the writing aspect and have less reading practice) but otherwise contain all the core content. The videos on the _JapanesePod101_ site also come with lesson notes, lots of vocab (with audio)) and the ability to create flashcards.

A little oddly, the lessons do not cover hiragana long vowels (they do get a bit of a mention in the katakana series) but _JapanesePod101_ does cover them elsewhere (see long vowel notes elsewhere in this `README`).

### Apps

After seeing it mentioned on YouTube, I actually did all my reading drill practice with:

* [Hiragana Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapps.hiragana)
* [Katakana Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapps.katakana)

The pay versions (that remove ads) costs just US$1.50.

The UI seemed a little non-obvious at the start so here are some quick notes:

* You can choose what you want to practice with the three tabs at the top - _Basic_, _Variants_ or _Combinations_.
* Pressing on any of the characters plays the its audio.
* But that's not the main point - once you've selected a tab, e.g. _Basic_, it's the four buttons at the bottom that are important:
  * The first button allows you to select between the normal go at your own pace mode and a timed compete against yourself mode.
  * The second button allows you to select between a multi-choice mode and a mode where you instead have to type the romaji for each character.
  * 🔁 - the third button is the most important - press it and a panel appears where:
    * You can select which column of kana you want to practice, e.g. just the first three if that's all you've learned so far.
    * ⭐ - stars - 1, 3, 5 or 10 - are how many times you want to be drilled on each character per practice session.
    * 🔀 - shuffle - whether you wanted the kana presented in a random order or the typical order that they appear in charts.
    * 🎓 - teaching mode - in this mode, each kana is introduced once with its sound without you being actually tested on it.
    * ▶️  - what it's all about - start a new practice session.
  * The last on the four buttons on the main screen is also a play button - but this just _resumes_ an existing practice session.

I always just used the third button - 🔁 - with one star selected, shuffle mode on and teaching mode off and pressed the play button there.

Once you start a session, you'll see e.g. a _0 / 46_ count, this is how many kana (or variants or combinations) you still need to complete for this session (if you selected 5 stars, then you'll have to complete 5 * 46 kana). Then above the current kana, you'll see a stars - this indicates how more times you've been tested on this kana in this practice session. There's also a back arrow to return to the main screen (and as noted, you can use the main ▶️  play button to resume the session). Oddly, there's no confetti or obvious end once you hit e.g. the full _46 / 46_ count - it just carries on testing you and it's up to you to press the back button to finish up if you want.

I found the option to let you select you many times you wanted to be drilled on each kana per round of practice a little odd. E.g. if you select a count of 5, it's not the case that you just see a given kana five times in a given round - you're actually forced to do a subset of the kana five times before going onto the next subset and so on. I always just switched to one star and simply repeated a practive round if I wanted to drill more than once.

Additional feature that I'd like are:

* Being able to test across everything is a single practice session, i.e. basic, variants and combinations.
* A mode where you hear the sound with the romaji multi-choice replaced by a kana multi-choice.
* A similar mode where you see the romaji and have a kana multi-choice.

Note: if you're online, I think Tofugu's [online quiz](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/) (mentioned above) offers very similar value to these apps.

JapanesePod101
--------------

_JapanesePod101_ is an excellent resource so I'm unhappy that my first note is a complaint. For some reason they maintain two flashcard like features:

* On many leasons you can chose to add vocabulary to their own [SRS flashcards system](https://www.japanesepod101.com/learningcenter/flashcards/flashcards#/) that you can practice on their website or on their app - there appears to be no way to export these cards to Anki
* They also have [wordbank system](https://www.japanesepod101.com/learningcenter/account/wordbank) which you can sync to their own flashcards system or export to XML (and from there potentially into Anki).

I think this is just a small part of _JapanesePod101_ so, I don't think they need to use it as a way to lock people into their service - I think they should have done this all using Anki or added proper Anki intergration.

Japanese keyboard
-----------------

My notes on kana and typing Japanese on a computer (which is done using hirigana) are in [`kana.md`](kana.md).

I never found the perfect up-to-date resouce on how to get started with typing but actually it's fairly simple once you've got over the initial WTF step.

In short search YouTube and, despite most of them being stale when it comes to describing the basic initial setup, you'll get there eventually.

For Mac, I like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzzYus2DgCg) from _Campanas de Japanese_.

There's also lots of web pages out there (also with lots of stale information). One I liked is Christopher Bolton's [guide](https://redcocoon.org/cab/j4mactyping.html) (but again, it's far from perfect - it describes how to manage speedier input without choosing your kanji after ever individual compound but doesn't cover basics like switching from hiragana to katakana).

_Jouzu Juls_ has a nice [How to Type Japanese on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3xmRCrbLVU) video.

Comprehensible input
--------------------

Something that comes again and again is comprehensible input - input you can understand without having to have it explained in your native language.

Finding comprehensible input when you don't yet know anything seems difficult.

What I've found so far:

* [_Comprehensible Japanese_](https://www.youtube.com/@cijapanese/playlists) - they have a number of playlist, including a [complete beginner one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPdNX2arS9Mb1iiA0xHkxj3KVwssHQxYP). They also suggest you may get more value watching their videos on their [paid content site](https://cijapanese.com/watch) rather than YouTube and they have a [guide](https://cijapanese.com/guide/intro) to getting the most out of their content.
* _Refold_ have a ["seeder" playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-umeYLvhtU&list=PLn4GkF3M9WXeGgs4G_N_BfT62sfm1DSa3) - they explain how to use this to create a YouTube immersion account for yourself [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zf5DGuD-XA) and then how to use this with a seeder playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3DiQgVF5e0).

They have a [full guide](https://refold.la/how-to-learn-japanese/) specifically for Japanese and it's got lots of free content as well as links to content that they sell (and some that they give away).

Tech
----

See [`tech.md`](tech.md) for my thought on options for consuming media on the go and for e.g. practicing stroke order.

Online dictionary
-----------------

[jiisho](https://jisho.org/) is the clear king here - they pull together information from a lot of sources (see the footer at the bottom of the example linked just below).

E.g. see their page for the kanji [四](https://jisho.org/search/%E5%9B%9B%20%23kanji).

You can also do English word lookup as well as Romaji and Japanese characters.

Refold
------

Refold has suffered reputation damage due its association with _Matt vs Japan_ (see above) but my impression is that it's genuine even if it tries to push courses etc. that are somewhat (only somewhat) pricier than the norm in a world where so much is free.

Their biggest thing is their [Teach yourself a language course](https://refold.la/category/courses/) which they sell for around US$150. Way back when there was a very popular approach called AJATT (all Japanese all the time), unfortunately the website went offline a long time ago (you can find it archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322030954/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/)). It was never a particularly structured approach and since then a number of shots have been made at coming up with a more structured formulation including MIA (massive immersion approach) which has also gone the way of the dodo. Refold seems to be the best that's been done so far in picking up the AJATT mantle.

Don't be confused - their main course isn't about learning Japanese, it's a course about how to learn a language, any language, i.e. how you should go about it, immersion, the steps etc. But they then have lots of content - much of it for Japanese (although Refold is used by many language learners, their biggest Discord community is Japanese). Some of the content for Japanese is free and some paid. Some of this content gets a poor rap as some of it was produced by _Matt vs Japan_ and some people claim its rather slap-dash - I can't comment. But my impression is that Refold genuinely have made an attempt to get past the whole _Matt vs Japan_ debacle since parting ways with him (while continuing to use some content developed by him).

Miraa
-----

I haven't seen much about AI and language learning but [miraa](https://miraa.app/) looks interesting - see this [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1kVdyLaxOA) by _Yuki Chiu_.

Shadowing
---------

I keep hearing about shadowing and it sounds very powerful but I don't have anything for this section yet.

Grammar
-------

### Bunpro

I keep on seeing reference to the site/web-app [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/) as a way to speed run learning Japanese grammar for self study. See Tofugu's [review](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/bunpro/), Weeb Jail's [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBOj45xt0vI) and others.

Bunpro is apparently very free format - you decide what you want to learn - which may not be great if you want a very directed approach. But they do have decks to accompany all kinds of sources including Genki.

### Tae Kim

I keep seeing references to Tae Kim’s [Grammar Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) as an amazingly accessible guide to Japanese grammar, e.g. this [one](samland.md).

There's a corresponding Anki [deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/911122782). It comes from [Japanese like a breeze](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/) and the follow-up decks are only available via their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jlabjapanese).

The deck requires an addon (or you can edit the template to achieve the same degree of control) in order to e.g. hide romaji and show Kanji with furigana. For full instructions, see the deck's [manual](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/guide-for-beginners/). As the manual notes, the only thing you can change, without affecting ones ability to update to a newer version of the deck, is the template.

You can also customize the cards, e.g. move images to the back, as covered [here](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/card-customization/). How the addon and the decks are intended to be used is described in a number of YouTube videos, starting with this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHFcHfvgX5c).

### Cure Dolly

Cure Dolly is another Japanese teacher with a near religous following (and she has some issues with Tae Kim's take on things that's covered in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x9hoAsh5-fjGDBw-17O5oTy)).

She has a huge "from scratch" lesson series [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj).

Note: Jouzu Juls has a grammar [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAaPL96Q8dWHx4H0WxdXLZlu7-DdbszsV) where he takes his shot at presenting some of her material in his own way where he hopes to "provide the same information with some enhancements and present it in a way that is open to more ears"

Piracy
------

I don't condone piracy but I have wanted to get digital versions of physical books that I've bought so that it's easier to e.g. copy things from them into flash cards. I don't think it's reasonable that one should have to pay for a digital version for this purpose if one has already bought a physical copy and I'd rather not work with DRM encumbered digital copies.

The solution to this is to download digital copies from [Anna'a Archive](https://annas-archive.org/).

Readings
--------

Kanshudo has a very nice [intro to readings](https://www.kanshudo.com/howto/how-to-read-kanji), how to learn them (one at a time) and how to guess which reading that you already know will apply in a new situation (based on whether the kanji is used okurigana etc.).

Tofugo has a rather more massive take on similar material [here](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/onyomi-kunyomi/).

### Reading frequency

There seems to be a definitive frequency dictionary of kanji - the Routledge [A Frequency Dictionary of Japanese](https://www.routledge.com/A-Frequency-Dictionary-of-Japanese/Tono-Yamazaki-Maekawa/p/book/9780415610131).

But I couldn't find anything similarly definitive for a frequency list of readings - given a kanji, I'd like figures on what are its most common readings.

I did find:

* [Kakimashou](https://www.kakimashou.com/dictionary/character/%E4%BA%BA) - I like that they use hiragana and katakana to distinguish between kun an on'yomi readings (this isn't standard but is fairly common in dictionaries - see this [note](https://www.sakurajapan.co.uk/post/the-difference-between-on-yomi-and-kun-yomi)).
* [jpdb](https://jpdb.io/search?q=%E4%BA%BA).

The both line up more-or-less on what they think are the most common readings. I also found various links to [ichi.moe](https://ichi.moe/cl/kanji/?q=%E4%BA%BA) as it also shows some kind of frequnency data for readings but it seems to be completely out of whack with Kakimashou or jpdb. This [comment](https://community.wanikani.com/t/which-site-for-kanji-readings-discrepancies/68756/4) in the Kanji section of the WaniKani forums seems to confirm my impression that ichi.moe data is suspect.

### Phonetic-semantic composition

> It seems that many kanji were created using a process called
> phonetic-semantic composition. This process joins two (or more) kanji
> (radicals), one (or more of them) usually called the bushu or dictionary
> section header establishes the meaning of the kanji, and another one,

See more [here](https://community.wanikani.com/t/wanikani-phonetic-semantic-composition-105-no-longer-supported/3878).

Matthias Wilhelm took the original WaniKani script, rewrote it and announced it [here](https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-keisei-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A3%B0-semantic-phonetic-composition/21479).

He maintains in on GitHub [here](https://github.com/mwil/wanikani-userscripts/tree/master/wanikani-phonetic-compounds) - it looks pretty cool but it may have [issues](https://github.com/mwil/wanikani-userscripts/issues/3) - however, from the thread where Matthias announced the script, it looks as if people are still clearly using it without issue.

TODO
----

Look at this sites that come up again and again:

* [JapanesePod101](https://www.japanesepod101.com/), they have no end of free content, e.g. this [4 hour intro to Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCILw-a0sdA) (despite the somewhat click-bait title, it seems good) but also have paid content (oddly the seem to have released this video a number of times on their channel, e.g. [here it is again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YV8KmfBbBM) four years earlier).
* [Rocket Japanese](https://www.rocketlanguages.com/japanese) - I know nothing about this but it seems to be a competitor to _JapanesePod101_.
