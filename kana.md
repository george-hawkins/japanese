Hiragana
--------

Go to _Settings / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Input Source_ to see the current shortcut to switch between English and Japanese - the default is `ctrl-space`.

Usually, the IME can work out when you need a small (chiisai) kana, e.g. type "sho" to get しょ. But you can use "x" to force this, e.g. "xo" becomes ぉ.

TODO: hiragana long vowels.

When found at the end of the word, the [sokuon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon) acts like a glottal stop (which may indicate angry or surprised speech). For example: あっ！ (from [here](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson/how-to-write-in-japanese-hiragana-and-katakana-4-the-hiragana-t-column?lp=160)).

Katakana
--------

After typing e.g. "su" press `ctrl-K` to switch it from hiragana to katakana.

* ヴ - vu e.g. voodoo  ヴードゥー (vu-du-)

### Digraphs

* イェ - ye

* ウィ - wi
* ウェ - we
* ウォ - wo

* ヴァ - va
* ヴィ - vi
* ヴェ - ve
* ヴォ - vo
* Where's vu? It's above - just ヴ on its own.

ウォ may seem odd as there is ヲ - this seems to sum up the web consensus:

> を/ヲ isn't really pronounced "wo" anymore, it's generally pronounced like お.
> The only real reason ヲ still exists is because its hiragana counterpart を
> is used as a grammatical particle. But since particles are usually written in
> hiragana, ヲ is mostly useless.
> 
> If you want to express the sound "wo", ウォ is your go-to notation.

* シェ - she (which in addition to plain シ and the normal digraphs シャ, シュ and ショ gives us the full set of sh* sounds).
* ジェ - je
