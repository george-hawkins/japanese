Tablet and more - early 2025
============================

I was looking for a tablet for e.g. consuming [Comprehensible Japanese](https://cijapanese.com/) content on the way into work or practicing stroke order with [Skritter](https://skritter.com/).

Maybe a table with pen support is overkill for Skritter (one can just use ones fingers) but below is what I came up with.

**Update:** it turns out Skritter only has beta support for active styluses.

Cheap-ish Samsung bundle
------------------------

* [Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) with pen](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-wlan-only-1040-64-gb-oxford-gray-tablets-44686953)
* [Samsung S6 cover with pen holder](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/samsung-book-cover-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-104-2020-tablet-cases-13084817)
* [Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/samsung-galaxy-buds2-pro-anc-5-h-wireless-headphones-21618879)

Note: this tablet also supports pens like the [Staedtler Noris](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/staedtler-noris-styluses-6405804?tagIds=82-1628-654).

Premium Apple bundle
--------------------

* [Apple iPad mini (2024)](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/apple-ipad-mini-2024-wlan-only-830-128-gb-purple-tablets-52242617)
* [Apple Smart Folio](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/apple-smart-folio-ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-ipad-mini-2024-7th-gen-tablet-cases-52242567)
* [Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/apple-pencil-pro-styluses-45556735)
* [Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/apple-airpods-pro-2nd-gen-magsafe-usb-c-anc-6-h-wireless-headphones-38610474)

There are a confusing array of pencils currently available, the Pro is the only one that seems to support all recent iPads. The USB-C Pencil does not support pressure sensitivity or magnetic pairing and the Gen 2 pencil only supports older pads. See Apple's [compatability page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108937).

Note: if considering other AirPods that most of the cheaper ones have no noise cancellation support.

Oddly the Smart Folio does not feature a pen holder and the only option seems to be to buy a stick on holder from a third party if you want that.

Cheaper non-pen bundles
-----------------------

Xiaomi:

* [Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE 8.7](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/xiaomi-redmi-pad-se-87-wlan-only-870-64-gb-graphite-gray-tablets-47230345)
* [Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/xiaomi-redmi-buds-5-pro-anc-7-h-wireless-headphones-41302777)

Samsung:

* [Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-wlan-only-11-64-gb-graphites-tablets-40187443)
* [Samsung Galaxy Buds FE](https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-anc-350-h-wireless-headphones-39171484)

Prices seem to depend on the phase of the moon, e.g. I've seen the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ for as low as CHF 140 and at other times at similar prices to the S6 Lite.

Note: if you're not looking for pen support then the Tab A9+ may actually provide more power for less money than the S6 Lite (I say "may" as the benchmarks seem confusing - some say the A9+ out-performs the S6 Lite and others say they're neck-and-neck or the S6 Lite is better - Samsung have a habit of issuing reissusing the same model, e.g. a 2024 refresh, which makes comparisons even more confusing).

Pens for normal tablets
-----------------------

You can also buy pens for the normal capacitive touch technology used by all pads not specifically designed for pens.

Oddly, no name-brand manufacturer seems to be big in the market for these pens and they all come from no-name Chinese suppliers. The most popular pen on any regional Amazon store seems to be fairly random with different brand names used for essentially identical products in different regions. These pens are extremely cheap because they're basically doing nothing more than looking like like the tip of your finger to the tablet (which just involves not blocking the your body's ability to disrupt the screen's electrostatic field, i.e. not act as an isulator in the way that e.g. most gloves do).

The big issue with using such pens (apart from issues like the lack of pressure sensitivity) is an issue called _palm rejection_. When writing on a sheet of paper, most people like to rest their hand/palm on the paper while doing so and tablets that are designed for use with pens ignore your palm if you rest it on the table while drawing with the pen. Normal capacitive touch tablets just see both the pen tip and your palm as touches and can't distinguish or reject/ignore your palm.

Here are some passive styluses that are available both on Amazon US and on the EU and UK stores (tho' from different sellers) and which seem to be reasonably popular in all regions:

* Mixoo 2-in-1 stylus - 34K - [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2OJX82/) / [EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01N2OJX82/)
* Meko 2-in-1 stylus - 16K - [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CPQJFFS/) / [EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00CPQJFFS/)
* ELZO stylus - 13K - [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071VG7C61/) / [EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B071VG7C61/)
* ELZO 3-in-1 stylus - 6K - [US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07235HQSG/) / [EU](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07235HQSG/)

The above brands appear in at least one or two online reviews. For whatever reason, Meko brand some of their pens Meko and some B&D (the one linked to above is branded B&D).

The numbers, 34K etc., are the number of reviews (an easily gamed metric) on the the Amazon US site for the given stylus.
