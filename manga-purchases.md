Manga print quality
===================

I bought a whole load of the top circulation manga listed on the Wikipedia [Japanese manga magazines by circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_manga_magazines_by_circulation) page.

Having received them, I'm not sure I'd recommend this unless you already know exactly what to expect.

Despite coming out weekly, they're absolute bricks similar to [telephone books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory) (if you're old enough to remember them) so they're surprisingly heavy which makes them expensive to ship from Japan.

But more importantly, the print quality is so low that they may feel unreadable to someone who hasn't grown accustomed to this since childhood. The paper is grey rather than white which massively reduces contrast and on top of that the print quality looks like something you'd get after running the original through a bad photocopier several times.

After trying to google for an explanation, I asked ChatGPT and it's explanation (see below) seems plausible. As it notes, I'd probably have been better buying just [tankōbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank%C5%8Dbon) (aka graphic novel) series for particular manga. But I'd liked the idea of the weekly anthologies of many different series.

Tankōbon
--------

Despite just commenting that maybe I should have just bought tankōbon, they also have issues. I liked the idea of having the physical books and thought it'd be much nicer than reading them on a tablet or laptop. But they seem to be uniformly very small format (around A5 size) and unless your eyesight is perfect, the text size is going to be fairly hard going (and not improved by the fact that you're in the process of learning the kanji involved). I suspect reading on a tablet would be a lot easier.

ChatGPT explains print quality
------------------------------

The greyish paper used in Japanese mass-market shōnen and shōjo manga magazines is an intentional cost-cutting measure, but there are a few additional reasons beyond just price.

### 1. Recycled Paper and Cost Efficiency

The main reason for the greyish tone is that these magazines are printed on low-cost, high-recycled-content paper. Unlike Western publications that use bright white paper (which often involves bleaching processes), Japanese publishers prioritise cost efficiency because weekly manga magazines are treated as disposable. The grey tone comes from the unbleached, mixed-fibre recycled paper used in production.

### 2. Speed of Production

Weekly manga magazines are produced in massive volumes and need to be printed, bound, and distributed extremely quickly. The pulpier, more absorbent paper allows ink to dry fast, preventing smudging and enabling rapid mass printing. White, higher-quality paper takes longer to dry and is more expensive, which would slow down production.

### 3. Cultural and Reading Habits

Japanese readers are accustomed to this kind of print quality and see these magazines as ephemeral—read once and discarded or recycled. Unlike Western comic books, which are often kept as collectibles, these magazines are not meant to be preserved. The cheap paper reinforces their temporary nature.

### 4. Weight and Bulk Considerations

Since weekly manga magazines contain hundreds of pages, using denser white paper would make them much heavier and more cumbersome to carry. The lightweight, lower-density grey paper keeps them portable and easy to handle.

### Why Don’t We See This in the West?

Western mass-market print media (like newspapers) also use lower-quality paper, but newspapers typically aim for a lighter, whiter shade for readability. The difference is that Western comics are generally printed on higher-quality stock to be kept and collected, while in Japan, the assumption is that the magazine will be disposed of quickly, so there’s no need for high-contrast, bright-white pages.

Interestingly, when manga is later compiled into tankōbon volumes, publishers switch to better-quality, whiter paper since these books are intended for long-term ownership.
