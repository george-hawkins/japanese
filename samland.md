Snipped from this [pdf](https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/samland/LearningJapanese.pdf),
this is Matthias Samland's take on Tae Kim’s [Grammar Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar).

It's just a typical example of the many rave reviews for this guide.

Learn basic grammar
-------------------

The best grammar guide in existence for westerners is in my opinion “Tae Kim’s Grammar Guide”, which
is freely available on the internet: http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar.

It is written in a much more accessible style than most normal text books and explains many deep
connections that are left out in the class room, but obvious to any native speaker. Instead of 
disconnected facts, it tells the story of Japanese grammar in a systematic way. Especially in Japanese you
often can’t help but wonder: “Why is stuff the way it is?” and this guide will provide (at least some)
answers to those questions. Plus, it does so in a way unburdened by heavy linguistic terminology. When I
started out, every chapter was a revelation to me.

Another important point is that it starts from the dictionary form and the colloquial speech instead of
formal speech, which is already conjugated into masu-form. Honestly, it isn’t very smart to learn the
conjugated form first and then learn how to unconjugate it… but don’t get me started on that topic.

What makes this guide even more attractive is that all the example sentences are available in an Anki
deck for download. So after finishing a chapter you can just add the example sentences to Anki and
review them on a regular basis. From my own experience, if you already finished RtK and work through
the Tae Kim chapters on essential and basic grammar: You can reach the grammar up to JLPT N4 in about
3 weeks. If you finish all the chapters your grammar will be at JLPT N2 level. Oh, did I mention that it is
free?
