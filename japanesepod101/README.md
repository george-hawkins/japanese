Learning the Kana (Hiragana and Katakana) is available as a free 2 hour video on YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wZHqOghvSs>

They have the same content available as lessons on their site [here](https://www.japanesepod101.com/lesson-library/how-to-write-in-japanese-hiragana-and-katakana).

On the site, they have lots of additional notes and vocab to go with the video (and the video doesn't have the persistent banner ad at the bottom that's there in the YouTube version).

And the videos have a section for each character that describes what to look out for when drawing it - these bits are left out from the YouTube version linked above.
