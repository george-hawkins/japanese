Skritter
========

I think I'm growing to like Skritter and in fact I think it's your only real app option for learning stroke order. However, the "getting started" experience isn't great.

I signed up first on the website before installing the app - if you go this route you have to provide a credit card or activation code (see the payment section below).

If you download the app, I believe you may be able to signup without providing either and use some free decks - but I can't confirm as I downloaded the app and used the sign-up I'd created on the website.

Aften that it assumes, you want to learn Chinese and so asks you what type of characters you want to learn.

Even if you flip to Japanese, the question remains:

Then it asks you if you want to _start with the basics_ or _pick your own list_, I went with the first option.

This was the first poor experience, it chose a deck called "Old JLPT N5" that rather inconsistently has an icon that clearly says "JLPT N2".

So, you're very first question is "why, as my very first deck, are they giving me something that they seem to be indicating is out-of-date" and do they have a bug with their deck icons.

And indeed, if you browse the available decks, you can find that they have another deck called "JLPT N5" (where the deck icon matches its name). So why not set you up wiht that deck? Or with the one of the nice basic hiragana or katakana decks that they have.

Once, I'd got this far, I then went and installed the _Skritter: Write Japanese_ app on my phone and signed in using the account I'd just created.

It walks you thru some basic Skritter usage and then dumps you on a main page that initially looks rather visually confusing.

But actually most of the things that I initially thought were setup elements or elements of the UI were essentially just news feed items.

Once I'd clicked them away (clicked the eye icon), it looked a bit more digestable:

But it's not very clear what you should do, even though you've got one deck sitting there, you're told there are no decks due.

I think at this point, they should probably push you straight to a YouTube video that walks you thru a first session with Skritter (and they should push you to the real YouTube app - they do have in app videos but on Android, at least, the in-app video playback experience is subpar vs YouTube and I'd rather flip-back and forward between Skritter and YouTube rather than use the in-app player).

In fairness, I suspect a link to the guide may have been one of the things I clicked away while trying to get a handle on what I was even looking at on the apps main page. Perhaps, this video should have been introduced as part of the tiny walk thru you get after opening the app for the first time.

On their website, they do have a [_Skritter Mobile Guide_](https://docs.skritter.com/article/214-skritter-mobile-guide):

And there's a useful video and links for explanations of all the elements. The video is hosted on Vimeo (which has gone to hell in the last few years, so the playback can be slow to start).

And if you click the link below the video, that should take you to the same video on Vimeo, you just get:

It seems they've got things currently set up so that this video restricted so it can only be played back if embedded in their site.

But they do also have the video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=gQaWYWn1HD0) on YouTube (so maybe they should update their website to point to this content).

Anyway, it turns out that you have to _learn_ content first before it starts appearing as due or avaiable for testing.

So, right from the start I find this a very odd aspect of Skritter - if you start working with a deck, there's no way to say "I'm already largely familiar with this content, I just want to be tested on it," instead you have to let Skritter teach you the content first, i.e. present the cards in a learning mode and for each card you have to click _Mark as Learned_.

This is quite exasperating and seems to imply Skritter thinks you'll never have learn anything independent of being taught it by Skritter. So, if e.g. you already know the content of the hiragana and katakana decks then look forward to clicking the _Mark as Learned_ button 139 times and 151 times for each respectively to convince Skritter of this. Or forever, unflick the _Learned only_ toggle for such decks when you hit the _Test_ button for them.

Other UI issues:

* Decks that I'd started using didn't always then appear in the _Recent Decks_ section and I'd have to browse for them. After a while they would be appear in _Recent Decks_.
* Occassionally, on completing a character, the _Forgot_ / _Got it_ options wouldn't show up, i.e. it behaved as there was still one or more strokes to complete even when this wasn't the case.

Payment
-------

For payment, the most direct option is to provide a credit card and, if you have one, enter a coupon code that gives you some discount on your subscription.

Skritter is used by academic institutions and activation codes are a mechanism that allows them to provide codes to students to enable them to signup for Skritter without requiring personal credit card details.

Like coupons, short-lived activation codes have been given out for promotional purposes.
